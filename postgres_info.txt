Each instance of postgres can be carved out into multiple separate databases.
So tow db - db1 and db2 can be totally unrelated but be an instance of your postgres database.

((GPT Explanation: ))
In PostgreSQL, an instance refers to a running PostgreSQL server process that manages a collection of databases. 
Each instance of PostgreSQL can host multiple databases, and these databases are isolated from each other. 
This means that databases within the same PostgreSQL instance can be completely unrelated, both in terms of data and schema, while being managed by the same server process.

Benefits of Multiple Databases in a Single Instance
Resource Management:
One PostgreSQL instance can manage resources such as memory and CPU for multiple databases, which can be more efficient than running separate instances for each database.
Simplified Management:
Managing a single instance with multiple databases can be simpler in terms of configuration, backups, and maintenance compared to managing multiple instances.
Isolation:
Each database can be isolated in terms of access control. Users can be granted permissions to specific databases without affecting others.
Cost Efficiency:
Running a single PostgreSQL instance for multiple databases can be more cost-effective in terms of server resources and administrative overhead.

Postgres creates a default database called 'postgres'
This is so that when you need to connect to the dbms, you need to mandatorily connect to a database

pg-admin is a goey which helps you interact with postgres without a lot of sql commands
however, if interested, go to the sql tab and see how the creation happens

psql is best as you shouldn't waste time using a using

Use sqlalchemy == 1.4.52, not 2.0 because that does not have long term support!
